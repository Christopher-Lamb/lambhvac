    text: "Bill Lamb was on time for my estimate, he was quick and professional. He laid out the options and costs without any attempt to give me the hard sell. He had the best price of the four vendors I interviewed. The job was done quickly and the place was spotless when he left. The new heater, air conditioner, and hot water heater all work great!",

    text: "These guys took on a very challenging job of removing the old furnace and replacing with new. This was all done in a dirt crawl space. I was afraid no one would take the job but the Lambs did at a more than reasonable price. Everything was done by the book. They are a team of experts.",

The issue was fixed quickly for a very reasonable price. This was the second time hes done work on our heater and he has always been professional and a pleasure to work with. Would definitely recommend!",
